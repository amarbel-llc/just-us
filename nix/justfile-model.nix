# Shared model-consumption helper for the seven `justfile-*` whole-tree linters.
#
# Every one of them used to shell out to `just --dump --dump-format json` and
# reconstruct recipe structure with jq — re-deriving what just's parser already
# computed and threw away. Two structural defects followed directly from that
# reconstruction, and both are fixed here by DELETING the reconstruction rather
# than patching it:
#
#   - conformist#85: the verb was extracted by splitting the recipe's key on
#     `-`, but a `mod`-imported recipe surfaces fully qualified
#     (`explore::debug-foo`), so the "verb" came out `explore::debug` and never
#     matched an allowlist. The model carries the BARE `name` and the `module`
#     path as separate fields, so splitting `name` is correct with no stripping
#     step at all.
#   - conformist#89: five of the seven read only the root `.recipes` and never
#     recursed into `.modules`, silently skipping every module recipe. The
#     model's `recipes` is a single FLAT list spanning the root and all modules,
#     so there is no subtree left to forget to recurse into. Routing all seven
#     through THIS helper is the other half of that fix: the roster cannot drift
#     apart again, because there is only one place that reads the model.
#
# A third defect went with them: the raw dump serializes a dependency as the
# depended-on recipe's BARE name (`keyed::serialize`), dropping any `mod::`
# qualifier, so justfile-task-hierarchy had to match ownership on ambiguous bare
# names and SKIP any leaf whose name appeared in more than one scope. The model's
# `dependencies[].namepath` is resolved, so that ambiguity-skip is gone.
#
# POLICY BOUNDARY (just-us FDR 0003, "Policy boundary"). The model is DATA only:
# it deliberately emits no `is_aggregate`, `is_leaf`, or `verb`. conformist keeps
# the eng POLICY — the verb allowlist, the lifecycle groups, the aggregate/leaf
# taxonomy — and applies it over the model's raw signals (`has_body`,
# `dependencies`, bare `name`, `groups`). The taxonomy definitions below are that
# policy; keep them here and out of just-us.
#
# THE FORK REQUIREMENT. `--dump-format model` is a just-us fork format; a stock
# `just` rejects it outright. That is a LOUD failure (the check exits 2), not a
# vacuous pass — unlike `doc_prelude`, whose absence a stock `just` would report
# as zero findings. The `just` binary each check runs comes from the shared
# `linters.justfile-common.justPackage` option (declared in `justfile-common.nix`,
# imported by every justfile-* linter), which is MANDATORY: orphan-summary reads
# `doc_prelude` and would pass vacuously against a stock `just`, so the whole
# family requires a just-us build to be wired explicitly. See `justfile-common.nix`.
#
# Usage: each linter module imports this and calls it with its own jq filter.
# The filter runs after the shared prelude and emits ONE LINE PER FINDING; the
# helper prefixes each with the linter name and exits 1, or prints okMessage and
# exits 0. The jq program is written to the store and passed with `jq -f`, so a
# finding message may contain single quotes without any shell-quoting hazard
# (the reason the old filters kept their human text in shell and passed tagged
# `FIRST:`/`DEP:` discriminants back out).
