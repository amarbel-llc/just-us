# conformist-justfile(7) AGGREGATES AND LEAVES: `default` must be the FIRST
# recipe, and it must contain only aggregate targets (recipes with no body of
# their own) — never leaves directly. Whole-tree check (passes-files=false):
# reads the native recipe model via `just --dump --dump-format model`, takes no
# file arguments. Prose origin: eng-design_patterns-justfile(7) DEFAULT RECIPE.
#
# WHY `root_default` IS THE RIGHT FIELD FOR "the first recipe". just resolves a
# justfile's default as: the `[default]`-attributed recipe if one exists, else the
# lowest-line-number recipe defined in the ROOT justfile (src/analyzer.rs). The
# raw dump's `.first` — what this check read before — is that same
# `Justfile::default` under a `serde(rename)`, so reading `root_default` is a
# behavior-preserving swap, not a new rule. It is also why this check does NOT
# reconstruct "first" from `line`/`source`: doing so would silently start
# disagreeing with just about which recipe bare `just` actually runs.
#
# SCOPE: the ROOT default only. The model's per-recipe `is_default` is PER-SCOPE
# (a module's own first recipe reads true), and `root_default` is the unambiguous
# root one. Requiring every module to have a `default` would be new enforcement,
# so this deliberately checks the root and leaves module scopes alone.
#
# The earlier awk heuristic (pre-#51) decided "has a body" by checking whether the
# NEXT PHYSICAL LINE after a dependency's definition was indented, which misread a
# backslash-continued aggregate (`foo: \` then an indented continuation line) as a
# body and false-positived (conformist#51, reported by purse-first). just's parser
# handles line continuations correctly, and `has_body` is that parser's own
# answer.
#
# conformist#89 / #85: dependency targets are now resolved by the model's
# `dependencies[].namepath` and looked up in the FLAT recipe list, so `default`
# depending on a `mod`-imported aggregate resolves correctly. The raw dump dropped
# the `mod::` qualifier from dependencies and this check only indexed the ROOT
# recipe table, so such a dependency silently found nothing and was never checked.
