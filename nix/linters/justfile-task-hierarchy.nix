# conformist-justfile(7) TASK HIERARCHY: aggregate recipes (no body, only
# dependencies) compose leaf recipes (those with a body). The eng spec's "every
# leaf belongs to exactly one aggregate" is a SHOULD with legitimate orphans, so
# conformist-justfile(7) pins the enforceable split:
#   - PIPELINE-VERB leaves (verb build/test/validate/verify/lint/codemod) MUST
#     belong to EXACTLY ONE aggregate — un-aggregated => unreachable from default;
#     in two => duplicated work.
#   - OTHER leaves (run/list/install/deploy/load/migrate/provision/restart/
#     bump/update/clean/debug/explore, plus tag/release) MAY be orphans but
#     MUST NOT belong to more than one.
#   - Private recipes are exempt.
# Whole-tree check (passes-files=false): reads the native recipe model via
# `just --dump --dump-format model`, takes no file arguments.
#
# `mod`-imported child justfiles are included: the model's `recipes` is one FLAT
# list spanning the root and every module (conformist#89), so both the leaves
# being checked and the aggregates that own them are found in a single pass.
#
# OWNERSHIP IS NOW EXACT (conformist#85's remaining caveat, closed). The raw
# `--dump-format json` serialized a dependency as the depended-on recipe's BARE
# name, dropping the `mod::` qualifier, so ownership had to be matched on bare
# names across scopes and any leaf whose bare name appeared in more than one
# scope was SKIPPED as ambiguous — a silent hole. The model's
# `dependencies[].namepath` is resolved, so matching is by fully-qualified
# identity and the ambiguity-skip is deleted: a duplicated bare name across two
# modules is now checked correctly rather than ignored.
#
# See conformist-justfile(7) TASK HIERARCHY and amarbel-llc/conformist#17.
