# conformist-justfile(7) VERB LIST: every recipe follows a verb-noun pattern
# where the verb is one of the canonical verbs. Whole-tree check
# (passes-files=false): reads the native recipe model via
# `just --dump --dump-format model`, takes no file arguments.
# conformist-justfile(7) VERB LIST is the single source of truth for the verb set
# below (it absorbed eng-design_patterns-justfile(7)'s prose, eng#189) — keep this
# hardcoded mirror in sync with that page alone.
#
# Exceptions: `default` (the special first recipe) and the eng-versioning(7)
# release recipes `tag` / `release` (which are not verb-noun by convention).
# Private recipes are exempt: they never appear in `just --list`, and this check
# previously read `just --summary`, which lists only public recipes — the model
# carries private ones too, so the exemption is now explicit.
#
# conformist#85: the verb comes from the model's BARE `name`, which never carries
# a `mod::` qualifier (that lives in `module`/`namepath`). A `mod`-imported
# recipe's verb is therefore correct with no stripping step; the old code split
# the qualified path and produced verbs like `explore::debug`, failing every
# recipe in a module. Findings report the `namepath` so the recipe is locatable.
