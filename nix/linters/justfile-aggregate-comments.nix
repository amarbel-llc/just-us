# conformist-justfile(7) AGGREGATES AND LEAVES: an aggregate recipe (no body,
# only dependencies) must NOT carry a doc comment — its dependency list is
# self-documenting (eng-design_patterns-justfile(7) ANTI-PATTERNS, "comments on
# aggregates"). The inverse of justfile-recipe-descriptions, which requires LEAF
# recipes to be documented. Whole-tree check (passes-files=false): reads the
# native recipe model via `just --dump --dump-format model`, takes no file
# arguments.
#
# conformist#89: this check read only the root `.recipes` of the raw dump and so
# silently skipped every `mod`-imported recipe. The model's `recipes` is one FLAT
# list spanning the root and all modules, so a commented aggregate inside a module
# is now flagged.
#
# See conformist-justfile(7) AGGREGATES AND LEAVES and amarbel-llc/conformist#17.
